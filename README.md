# Docker and NVIDIA Container Toolkit Installation Guide

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for installing Docker and configuring it to use NVIDIA GPUs on an Ubuntu-based system. This setup is essential for running GPU-accelerated applications in a containerized environment.

## Prerequisites

-   An Ubuntu-based Linux distribution.
-   An NVIDIA GPU with the appropriate proprietary drivers already installed.
-   `sudo` privileges.

## Step 1: Uninstall Old Docker Versions (Cleanup)

To prevent conflicts, it's best to start by removing any old or unofficial Docker packages from your system.

```bash
for pkg in docker.io docker-doc docker-compose docker-compose-v2 podman-docker containerd runc; do 
  sudo apt-get remove -y $pkg
done
```

## Step 2: Install Docker Engine
These commands will set up Docker's official apt repository and install the Docker Engine.

### 2.1. Set Up the Repository

Update the apt package index and install packages to allow apt to use a repository over HTTPS
```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y ca-certificates curl
sudo install -m 0755 -d /etc/apt/keyrings
```

Add Dockerâ€™s official GPG key
```
sudo curl -fsSL [https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg](https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg) -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc
sudo chmod a+r /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc
```
Set up the repository
```
echo \
  "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc] [https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu](https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu) \
  $(. /etc/os-release && echo "${UBUNTU_CODENAME:-$VERSION_CODENAME}") stable" | \
  sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null
```
